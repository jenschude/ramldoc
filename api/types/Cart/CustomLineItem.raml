    description: |-
      The total price of this custom line item.
               If custom line item is discounted, then the `totalPrice` would be the discounted custom line item price multiplied by `quantity`.
               Otherwise a total price is just a `money` multiplied by the `quantity`.
               `totalPrice` may or may not include the taxes: it depends on the taxRate.includedInPrice property.
