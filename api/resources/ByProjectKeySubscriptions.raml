    The creation of a Subscription is eventually consistent, it may take up to a minute before it becomes fully active.
    In order to test that the destination is correctly configured, a test message will be put into the queue.
    If the message could not be delivered, the subscription will not be created.
    The payload of the test message is a notification of type ResourceCreated for the resourceTypeId subscription.
    Currently, a maximum of 25 subscriptions can be created per project.
